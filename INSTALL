         How to get binaries from source:
         -------------------------------
  
         -> cd <MiMPI directory>
  
            To go to the MiMPI base directory.
  
         -> vi configure.in

            [ OPTIONAL ] To add or change any option you wish.
  
         -> autoconf

            Command to use in order to generate the "configure" script.
  
         -> ./configure
  
            Use ./configure in order to check your system and to generate the associated Makefiles.
  
         -> make
  
            Compile MiMPI as a library ( lib/libmpi.a ),
            a daemon needed to run ( bin/ns.exe ) and some
            examples ( example/* )
  

         How to install binaries into system:
         -----------------------------------
  
         -> cp lib/libmpi.a     <system library path>
            cp include/mpi.h    <system includes path>
            cp bin/ns.exe       <system binary path>
  
            System library path are usally /lib or /usr/lib.
            System includes path is /usr/include and
            System binary path can be /bin or /usr/bin.
  
  
         Some test for MiMPI:
         --------------------
  
          -> cd test
        
             Go to test directory.
        
          -> make
        
             Compile many test. Some options are plataform-bounded.
